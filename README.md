A step-by-step workshop for learning React fundamentals. Best if accompanied with live facilitation. ðŸ™‚

## Many thanks!

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) - makes it painless to spin up a React environment
- [React Docs](http://facebook.github.io/react) - lots of content has been borrowed from here
- [Vincent Budrovich](https://github.com/vwb) for his Redux tutorial contributions
- ...and other contributors for their docs and code fixes

## To run completed app

You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6 or higher. You can [install `nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) to manage multiple versions of node.

[Fork the repo](https://github.com/benmvp/react-workshop/fork) and create a local clone (be sure to replace `<YOUR-USERNAME>` with your own):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/react-workshop.git
```

Change to [`end/`](end/) directory:

```sh
cd react-workshop/end
```

Install all of the dependencies ([`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is preferred):

```sh
# Yarn
yarn

# ...or NPM
npm install
```

Start the API server (running at [http://localhost:9090/](http://localhost:9090/)):

```sh
# Yarn
yarn run start:api

# ...or NPM
npm run start:api
```

In a **separate terminal window/tab**, making sure you're still in the [`end/`](end/) directory, start the app:

```sh
# Yarn
yarn start

# ...or NPM
npm start
```

After the app is initially built, a new browser window should open up at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## Exercises

All of the exercises make use of [ES6](http://www.benmvp.com/learning-es6-series/), so you may need to brush up on the new JavaScript features if they are unfamiliar. Each step in the workshop builds on top of the previous one. If at any point you get stuck, you can find the answers in the source code of the current step. Any  step can be used as a starting point to continue on to the remaining steps.
